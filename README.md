Turbinado Physics Engine
=========
An overly ambitious, in-way-over-my-head, project to enter the world of computing graphics. 
=========
This engine is based on the Cyclone engine developed by I.D. Millington for his book, 
"Game Physics Engine Development" - http://procyclone.com/

Much of my code is sampled from the source code as I work along side the progress of examples
in the book.
